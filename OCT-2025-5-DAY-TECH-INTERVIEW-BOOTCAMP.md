## ⚠️ COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### WEEK 1 MISTAKES:

❌ **Random LeetCode grinding** without pattern focus
✅ **Pattern-based learning** - master one pattern before next

❌ **Applying without company research**
✅ **Tailored applications** - company-specific resumes and cover letters

❌ **Ignoring behavioral prep**
✅ **STAR stories ready** - technical skills alone won't get offers

❌ **Not timing applications optimally**
✅ **Thursday 9-11 AM, Sunday 3-5 PM PHT** - astrological advantage

❌ **Generic GitHub profile**
✅ **Relevant projects** - showcase work aligned with target companies

---

### INTERVIEW MISTAKES:

❌ **Solving silently**
✅ **Think out loud** - communication is 50% of evaluation

❌ **Jumping to code immediately**
✅ **Clarify requirements** - ask questions, discuss approach first

❌ **Using "we" in behavioral answers**
✅ **Use "I"** - interviewers want to know YOUR specific contributions

❌ **Not quantifying results**
✅ **Metrics matter** - "improved performance by 40%" vs "made it faster"

❌ **Blaming others in failure stories**
✅ **Take ownership** - show growth and learning
