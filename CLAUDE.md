# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is a comprehensive job hunting system repository focused on remote software engineering positions, particularly targeting opportunities from the Philippines perspective. The repository contains strategic documentation and tracking systems for systematic job application campaigns.

## Key Files Structure

- **ULTIMATE_JOB_HUNTING_SYSTEM_2025.md** - Master consolidated report containing 60+ verified remote positions with application tracking table, salary intelligence, and astrological timing optimization
- **FINAL_MASTER_PROMPT_ULTRATHINK.md** - Weekly job hunting operation template with 18-agent deployment architecture for continuous opportunity discovery
- **logs/** - Session logs and system tracking files
- **batch_[DATE]/** - Historical batch processing results
- **verification_[DATE]/** - Company verification data
- **templates/** - Application templates and frameworks

## Core System Architecture

The job hunting system operates on a multi-agent architecture:

### Agent Teams
1. **Alpha Team (10 agents)** - Traditional job board scraping (RemoteOK, LinkedIn, WeWorkRemotely, etc.)
2. **Beta Team (4 agents)** - Non-traditional source discovery (GitHub, Discord, alternative platforms)  
3. **Gamma Team (2 agents)** - Database verification and intelligence
4. **Delta Team (2 agents)** - Market analysis and optimization

### Key Components
- **Application Tracker** - Clickable URL format with astrological timing optimization
- **Salary Intelligence** - Philippines purchasing power analysis with compensation tiers
- **Technical Stack Analysis** - Market demand tracking for JavaScript/TypeScript, React, Python, Go, Rust
- **Geographic Optimization** - Philippines/Asia/Worldwide eligibility verification

## Common Development Tasks

This repository primarily contains documentation and data files rather than executable code. The main workflows involve:

### Data Updates
- Weekly opportunity discovery and verification
- Market intelligence report generation
- Application tracking and status updates

### File Management
- CSV generation for opportunity data
- Markdown table formatting with clickable URLs
- Batch processing result archival

## Key Metrics and Targets

- **Weekly Target**: 40+ verified premium opportunities
- **Application Volume**: 10-15 strategic applications per week
- **Response Rate Goal**: 25-30% (vs industry 10-15%)
- **Success Timeline**: 4-8 weeks to quality offers

## Astrological Integration

The system incorporates cosmic timing optimization:
- **Optimal Application Windows**: Thursday 9-11 AM, Sunday 3-5 PM (local timezone)
- **Weekly Energy Flow**: Monday intelligence gathering, Thursday peak applications
- **Moon Phase Integration**: New moon intentions, full moon peak energy applications

## Geographic Focus

Primary target markets with verified remote hiring:
- **Philippines-friendly companies**: 202 verified companies in database
- **Global remote-first**: Automattic, GitLab, Buffer, Vercel, etc.
- **Asia-Pacific timezone**: Optimal overlap with US/European teams

## Technology Stack Priorities

Based on market analysis of 60+ verified positions:
1. **JavaScript/TypeScript** (75% demand)
2. **React** (58% demand)
3. **Python** (50% demand)
4. **Go/Golang** (30% demand, premium rates)
5. **Rust** (13% demand, emerging high-value)

## Usage Notes

- This is a strategic planning repository, not a traditional codebase
- Focus on data accuracy and opportunity verification
- Maintain clickable URL format in application trackers
- Preserve astrological timing recommendations for application optimization
- Use Philippine timezone (PHT) for optimal application timing calculations
