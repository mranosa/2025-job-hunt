## FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS

**Q: Why is Supabase APAC #1 over higher-paying positions?**
A: Astrological fit considers ALL chart factors. Supabase APAC hits: APAC timezone (Moon), TypeScript (Gemini), startup equity (Mars), Series D stability (Jupiter), open-source (Mercury). It's the ONLY position hitting ALL 5 major indicators. Higher salary alone doesn't equal better cosmic alignment.

**Q: Should I apply to 6/10 positions if I get responses from 9-10/10?**
A: No. Focus energy on highest-fit positions first. If you receive 2-3 offers from 9-10/10 positions, you've succeeded. Only expand to 6/10 tier if Week 1-2 responses are below expectations.

**Q: Why are some high-salary Web3 positions rated 7/10 instead of 9-10/10?**
A: Ethena Labs ($180-230K) is 7/10 because it's DeFi-only (Solidity primary, TypeScript secondary). While Web3 aligns with Rahu 10th, the lack of APAC timezone explicit mention and Solidity learning curve reduces fit. Supabase APAC at $120-180K scores 10/10 due to perfect chart alignment across ALL factors.

**Q: Do I need to apply during exact cosmic windows?**
A: Thursday 9-11 AM PHT is OPTIMAL but not mandatory. The cosmic window increases probability of:
- Application reviewed faster (Thursday = Jupiter day = expansion/opportunity)
- Better first impression (morning energy = fresh recruiter mindset)
- Alignment with chart (your 10th house activated during peak career hours)

If you miss Thursday window, Sunday 3-5 PM PHT is secondary. Monday-Wednesday are acceptable but sub-optimal.

**Q: What if I don't have AI/ML experience for AssemblyAI?**
A: AssemblyAI has "Platform Engineer" roles (infrastructure) that don't require ML expertise. Apply emphasizing:
- TypeScript/Python backend mastery
- Platform/infrastructure experience (Docker, K8s, AWS)
- API design and scalability
- Willingness to learn ML context (not implement ML models)

**Q: Should I apply to Japan positions if I need to relocate?**
A: Yes, if you're open to relocation. Your Moon in Sagittarius 7th house favors APAC partnerships and Asian cultural experience. Japan positions offer:
- Engineer visa (straightforward for software engineers)
- High compensation (¬•6M-15M = ‚Ç±2.64M-6.6M)
- English-sufficient environment (no Japanese needed)
- Strong Filipino community in Tokyo

However, prioritize remote positions (Supabase APAC, AssemblyAI, Better Auth) first. Apply to Japan Week 3-4.
