‚úÖ Request relocation assistance and visa sponsorship costs coverage

**DON'T:**
‚ùå Accept first offer immediately (always negotiate)
‚ùå Compare only nominal salary without cost of living adjustment

3. "Are there opportunities for international mobility within the company?"

### Red Flags to Watch For:

‚ö†Ô∏è Company refuses to discuss visa sponsorship clearly
‚ö†Ô∏è Salary significantly below market rate without justification
‚ö†Ô∏è No relocation assistance for international hire
‚ö†Ô∏è Vague answers about visa timeline or process
‚ö†Ô∏è Pressure to accept offer immediately without time to consider
