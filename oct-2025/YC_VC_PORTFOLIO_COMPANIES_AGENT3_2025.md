   - Cultural affinity with Western work styles

3. **Cost Efficiency**
   - Companies save 30-50% vs US-based remote engineers
   - Still offer competitive local wages ($100K-$150K range)
   - Win-win for both sides

4. **Tech Talent Pool**
   - Growing tech hub (Manila, Cebu, Davao)
   - YC-backed companies already hiring here (Kalibrr, Shipmates, Bot MD)
   - Proven track record

**Visa Sponsorship Path:**
