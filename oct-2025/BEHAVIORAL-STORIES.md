# Behavioral Interview Stories - STAR Method Template

Use this template to prepare 7 core stories that cover common behavioral interview questions.

---

## What is the STAR Method?

**S**ituation → **T**ask → **A**ction → **R**esult

- **Situation** (1-2 sentences): Set the context
- **Task** (1 sentence): Explain your responsibility
- **Action** (3-4 sentences): Describe what **YOU** did (not "we")
- **Result** (1-2 sentences): Share the outcome with metrics

**Total length**: 1.5-2 minutes per story

## Story 1: Technical Challenge

**Common Questions:**
- "Tell me about the most complex technical problem you've solved"
- "Describe a challenging bug you had to fix"
- "Tell me about a time you had to debug a production issue"

**Template:**

**Situation:**
```
What was the context? What was the problem?
Example: "At [Company], our API response times increased from 200ms to 5s, affecting 10,000 users"
```

**Task:**
```
What was your responsibility?

## Tips for Great STAR Stories

### DO:
- ✅ **Use specific metrics**: "Reduced latency by 60%" vs "Made it faster"
- ✅ **Focus on YOUR actions**: Say "I" not "we" when describing actions
- ✅ **Be honest**: Authenticity is memorable
- ✅ **Show growth**: Especially in failure stories
- ✅ **Keep it concise**: 1.5-2 minutes max
- ✅ **Practice out loud**: Sounds different than reading

### DON'T:
- ❌ **Ramble**: Stay focused on the story structure
- ❌ **Blame others**: Take responsibility, even for team issues
- ❌ **Use vague language**: "Kind of", "sort of", "maybe"
- ❌ **Skip the result**: The outcome is crucial
- ❌ **Memorize word-for-word**: Sound natural, not rehearsed
- ❌ **Use only technical jargon**: Interviewer might not be technical

| **Wolt** | Operational excellence, data-driven | Metrics, process improvement, scale |
| **Buffer** | Transparency, autonomy, remote work | Async communication, self-direction |
| **Chainlink** | Decentralization, security | Security-focused, distributed systems |
| **Automattic** | Writing skills, distributed work | Documentation, async everything |
| **Japan companies** | Quality, teamwork, long-term thinking | Attention to detail, collaboration |
| **Finland companies** | Efficiency, directness, work-life balance | Results-focused, honest communication |
