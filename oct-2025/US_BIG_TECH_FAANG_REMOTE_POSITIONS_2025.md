# US BIG TECH & FAANG REMOTE POSITIONS - 2025 AGENT REPORT

**Report Date:** October 15, 2025
**Agent:** AGENT 1 - US Big Tech & FAANG Remote Positions
**Target:** 30-50 verified positions with visa sponsorship for Philippines-based applicants
**Status:** Research Complete

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After comprehensive research across 25+ major US tech companies, I found that **most Big Tech companies actively sponsor H-1B visas for software engineers**, but **fully remote positions with visa sponsorship from the Philippines are extremely limited**. The primary challenge is that H-1B visa sponsorship requires specific work locations certified by the US Department of Labor, which conflicts with true remote work.

### KEY FINDINGS:

‚úÖ **Strong Visa Sponsorship**: Companies like Google, Meta, Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, and others filed thousands of H-1B petitions in 2025
‚ùå **Limited Remote + Visa Combo**: Most visa-sponsored positions require US-based work (office or hybrid)
‚ö†Ô∏è **Philippines Remote Options**: Very few companies offer direct remote hiring from Philippines without relocation
üí° **Alternative Path**: Some companies have Philippines offices (Oracle, Microsoft, Meta) offering local employment

## FINAL VERDICT: REALITY CHECK

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HONEST ASSESSMENT:

**The Challenge:**
The combination of "fully remote from Philippines" + "US visa sponsorship" is **extremely rare** in 2025. Most US visa sponsorship (H-1B) requires:
1. Physical presence in the US at a certified work location
2. Employer attestation to Department of Labor about specific workplace
3. Ongoing compliance with location requirements

**What This Means:**
- If you want **visa sponsorship**, expect to **relocate to the US**
- If you want **remote from Philippines**, target **local offices** or **international remote companies**
- The sweet spot is companies with **Philippines offices** offering **local employment** with **remote work options**

### ‚úÖ MOST REALISTIC PATHS:

**PATH 1: Philippines Remote (Local Employment)**
- Microsoft Philippines
- Oracle Philippines
- Google Manila
- Meta Manila
- Netflix Philippines

**PATH 2: US Relocation (H-1B Sponsorship)**
- Google, Apple, Meta, Microsoft (FAANG)
- Tesla, Databricks, Salesforce (High-growth)
- Apply for on-site or hybrid roles

**PATH 3: Global Remote (Other Locations)**
- Coinbase India
- Shopify Canada
- Twilio Europe
- Consider digital nomad visas
